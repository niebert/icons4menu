## Create your own Icons
If you want to create your own items you can use

* **([InkScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape))** the [open source software InkScape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape) - Download: [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/download ).
* **([LibreOffice Draw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Draw))** Alternatively you can also use [LibreOffice-Draw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Draw) and load the example  icons `icons-odg/` or the icon templates `icons-odg/icon-empty.odg` or  `icons-odg/icon-frame.odg`.

If you want to export the new icon please use the SVG file format. The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) defines the image with the Extensible Markup Language as (XML)-based vector image for two-dimensional graphics.
The format has the advantage, that increasing the size of the icon does not create pixel effects, because the icon is defined by geometric shapes and not a raster of pixels.

Save the icon with 14x14 pixel for width and height, so that the icon has a standard size for a menu if not additional size attributes are used in CSS or the `img`-tag itself.

# Icons4Menu
This repository is a SVG images resource based on SVG icons [JQuery Mobile 1.4.5](https://jquerymobile.com/download/) and extended with SVG icons from Wiki Commons. The icons are primary collected for application in menus with e.g. Hamburger Menus like [hamburger_menu_app](https://niebert.github.io/hamburger_menu_app/) as an [AppLSAC](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/AppLSAC).

## Download of Icons with a Script
The icons can be downloaded with a script:
* [wget_icons.sh](https://niebert.github.io/icons4menu/wget_icons.sh)
* The download of icons for your WebApp (resp. [AppLSAC](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/AppLSAC)) can be started from the shell command line with
```
   sh ./wget_icons.sh
```
* the script call of [wget_icons.sh](https://niebert.github.io/icons4menu/wget_icons.sh) downloads the SVG icons of this repository and it is equivalent to the script call:
```
   sh ./wget_icons.sh svg
```
* if you want to download the PNG icons of the repository (JQuery Mobile 1.4.5 - CC0) you can call the script with the parameter `png`:
```
   sh ./wget_icons.sh png
```

## Update the `wget_icons.sh` Script
Any time new icons are added to the repository `icons4menu` the script `wget_icons.sh` is updated as well, because the new icons are added to the list of `wget` download commands in the script. There is an easy way to update the `wget_icons.sh` script to the latest version by downloading the script   [`update_wget_icons.sh`](https://niebert.github.io/icons4menu/update_wget_icons.sh). If you want to use the update script, navigate to the folder in which you want to have the `icons4menu` folder `img/` and then download the script with:
```
  wget https://niebert.github.io/icons4menu/update_wget_icons.sh
```
Please check the content of the script before executing, so that you are sure that the script does what you expect the script to (i.e. updating the script `wget_icons.sh`). Then check the content of `wget_icons.sh`. Performs the script the expected down or do you want to reduce the number of downloaded icons before executing the script `wget_icons.sh`. If you are sure that the script download all the icons you need, perform the download operation by calling:
```
  sh ./wget_icons.sh
```

## JSON file `json4icons.json` and `json4icons.js`
The JSON file `json4icons.json` contains a list of all icons with
* `name`: filename,
* `path`: the path to the icon,
* `license`: the license information for the icon,
* `src`: is the base64 encoded data of the image as Data URL that can used in images in the DOM. The source us either the `XML` source text of the `SVG` image or the binary data as base64 encoded data of the image.

The file `json4icons.js` is a library that populates a hash object `vDataJSON` defined with `var vDataJSON = {};` in the main HTML file that embeds the `icons4menu`.

## JSON File Icons4Menu
The repository contains also a [JSON file](https://niebert.github.io/icons4menu/json4icons.json) with all icons of the repository. The JSON file [`json4icons.json`](https://niebert.github.io/icons4menu/json4icons.json) can be used to identify the used icons with NodeJS and delete the unused icons from your `img/` folder of your WebApp to save disk space and reduce the size of your WebApp.

Even if you remove icons from your WebApp in the folder `img/` you should keep the license file `LICENSE_Jquery_Mobile.txt`, `README.md` and `README_Icons4Menu.html` in that repository for licensing information about the icons.
